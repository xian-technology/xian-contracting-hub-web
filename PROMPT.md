# Ralph BUILDING Loop

## Goal
create a smart contract hub, something like a smart contract repository website where curated smart contracts can be listed and managed and viewed.

## Context
- Read: specs/*.md (requirements and design)
- Read: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (your task list)
- Read: AGENTS.md (test commands, project conventions, learnings, human decisions)

## Rules
1. Pick the **single** highest priority incomplete task from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Investigate the relevant code BEFORE making changes
3. Implement **only that one task** — do NOT continue to the next task
4. Run the backpressure commands from AGENTS.md (lint, test)
5. If tests pass:
   - Commit with a clear, conventional message (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
   - Mark the task as done in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: `- [x] Task`
6. If tests fail:
   - Attempt to fix (max 3 tries per task)
   - If still failing after 3 attempts, notify for help
7. Update AGENTS.md with any operational learnings
8. **Stop.** The outer loop will invoke you again for the next task.

## Error Handling
If you encounter issues:
- Missing dependency: Try to add it, if unsure notify
- Unclear requirement: Check specs/ and AGENTS.md (Human Decisions section), if still unclear notify
- Repeated test failures: Notify after 3 attempts
- Blocked by external factor: Notify immediately

## Notifications
The outer loop (ralph.sh) handles most notifications automatically (errors, progress, completion).
You only need to write a notification when YOU are blocked and need human input:

```bash
mkdir -p .ralph
cat > .ralph/pending-notification.txt << 'NOTIF'
{"timestamp":"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")","prefix":"DECISION","message":"Brief description of what you need","details":"Full context","status":"pending"}
NOTIF
```

Use prefix `DECISION` for design choices, `BLOCKED` for missing deps/credentials.

## Completion
When ALL tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md are marked done:
1. Run final test suite to verify everything works
2. Add this line to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: `STATUS: COMPLETE`
